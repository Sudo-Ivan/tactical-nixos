# tactical-nixos

I am creating a [NixOS ISO](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Creating_a_NixOS_live_CD) with pre-configured SDR software, Offline Mapping, Waydroid (Android Emulation), Wine (Windows Emulation), OSINT and Red Team Tools. I'll be using Gnome for its ease of use and touchscreen compatibility. Users have the choice of changing anything in the configuration to their liking, I just want to provide a easy starting point for non-technical users.

**Security First**
I will not make the source code public for my applications until it's stable and secure.

**Tactical Command Center**
This is a central application launcher and manager, built with Tauri and Leptos. Current planned software includes:

* Mission Planning
* Secure Chat using [Reticulum Stack](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum)
* sUAS Command and Control
* Voice Cloning
* Radio Direction Finding

**FPGA Encryption Integration**
There will be an optional package to integrate FPGA encryption from [Kryptor FPGA](https://www.crowdsupply.com/skudo/kryptor-fpga) and using a Raspberry Pi for FPGA level encryption of my applications.
