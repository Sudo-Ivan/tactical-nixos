# tactical-nixos

Tactical NixOS is a custom NixOS ISO with implemented SDR, Mapping, Waydroid, Wine, Bottles, OSINT and Red Team Tools.

I am using Gnome because it works great with touchscreen out the box.

Tactical Command Center will be free and open-source, but I will not be releasing it until it is stable and secure.

**Check out a early preview:**
