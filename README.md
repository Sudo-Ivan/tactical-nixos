# tactical-nixos

Tactical [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a custom [NixOS ISO](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Creating_a_NixOS_live_CD) with pre-configured SDR software, Offline Mapping, Waydroid (Android Emulation), Wine (Windows Emulation), OSINT and Red Team Tools.

I will be using Gnome because it works great with touchscreen and easy to use for most folks out the box. But nothing is stopping you from editing the configuration and changing this.

## Security is priority

I will not be making the source code for these applications public until it is stable and secure. 

## Tactical Command Center

Tactical Command Center is a central application launcher and manager, it is being built using Tauri and Leptos.

**Current Planned Software:**

Mission Planning
Secure Chat using [Reticulum Stack](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum)
sUAS Command and Control
Voice Cloning
Radio Direction Finding

**FPGA Encryption Integration**

There will be a optional package to integrate FPGA encryption versus software-based for my software. This is something my team will be using because we have a high privacy and security model.
